# Smart Home Automation Using The Raspberry Pi
# Student Name: Nikola Angelkovski
# Student ID: 20095550
# Introduction
This is a small project made by me for the "IoT Standards & Protocols" course from the Waterford Institute of Technology in Waterford, Ireland. The goal of the project is to make the Raspberry Pi the central hub for controlling IoT devices in the home, such as smart doors, smart fridges etc. The Raspberry Pi can be accessed from a smartphone/tablet/laptop/PC. See the detailed information about the project below.
# Tools, Technologies and Equipment
For this project I will be using the following tools, technologies and equipment:
- A Raspberry Pi 4 model B (2GB RAM)
- A Sense HAT add-on board for the Raspberry Pi, which can be used for getting various data such as temperature, humidity, barometric pressure etc. and also getting audiovisual feedback through the built-in 8x8 RGB LED matrix and connected speakers.
- Packet Tracer by Cisco, a cross-platform visual simulation tool that allows users to create network topologies and imitate modern computer networks. This will be used for simulating IoT devices in a home network, and will be controlled by an external app through the Raspberry Pi
- Amazon AWS IoT, an Amazon Web Services platform that collects and analyzes data from internet-connected devices and sensors and connects that data to AWS cloud applications. This will be used to develop an external application which will be used to send commands to the IoT devices through the Raspberry Pi
- An Android smartphone to showcase the application and its use in the real world
- A laptop/PC to run the simulations for the project and develop the application
- Visual Studio Code- used for connecting to the RPi via SSH and writing the necessary code 
# Visual representation of the project
The two pictures below explain how the project should work once everything is set up. The first picture is a roadmap for the development of the project, and the second picture is a diagram which shows visually how the components are going to be connected in the end, with detailed explanation of how the information flows through the components.

# Note
Please note that the above text is subject to change as I progress further into development and more features are added. All the diagrams, pictures, code and websites will be added in subsequent commits.
