## Welcome to my project website!

Here you will find all the details for my IoT project- "Smart Home Automation Using The Raspberry Pi". Each part of the project is divided into sections below, so you can have easy access to everything. If you like my project, feel free to leave a comment or a suggestion.

# Tools, Technologies and Equipment
For this project I was using the following tools, technologies and equipment:

- A Raspberry Pi 4 model B (2GB RAM)
- A Sense HAT add-on board for the Raspberry Pi, which can be used for getting various data such as temperature, humidity, barometric pressure etc. and also getting audiovisual feedback through the built-in 8x8 RGB LED matrix and connected speakers.
- Packet Tracer by Cisco, a cross-platform visual simulation tool that allows users to create network topologies and imitate modern computer networks. This was used for simulating IoT devices in a home network, and is controlled by an external app through the Raspberry Pi
- An Android smartphone to showcase the application and its use in the real world
- A laptop/PC to run the simulations for the project and develop the application
- Visual Studio Code was used to create an SSH connection to the Raspberry Pi and write the necessary code

# Visual Representation of the Project
The diagram below shows how the whole project works when everything is set up, as well as how the data flows through the elements. Another diagram which contains the development roadmap can be found on my GitHub page about this project.

# Project Tutorials and Files
I have created a small [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLknVyGBYudWuT1P1lZ_0AwqsM6FiRtyYy) on YouTube which has short tutorials about the project. I also added a folder which includes all the files for the project, as well as separate codes for each individual element, in case you want to implement some other stuff by yourself, or the given "Smart Home Project" does not work properly.
